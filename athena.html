Household income may have decreased or disappeared due to Stay At Home orders and pandemic-related layoffs, leading to further fear and unrest in their household, and potential loss of security and safety as their bills go unpaid.</p><br><p>Individuals experiencing domestic violence need help when in immediate or ongoing danger, from their emergency contacts, local doctors if they are injured, and local emergency shelters, all in secret from their abuser to minimize further conflict. However, individuals who experience abuse in their homes may have trouble compiling the resources necessary to escape as they may not have privacy from their abusers.* Individuals who can’t safely save resources like emergency contacts, websites, and critical information, must rely on their memory in high-stress situations which may impair memory retrieval. If the survivor forgets to delete messages sent to emergency contacts, or clear their search history of DV resources, they risk the abuser finding evidence of their plans, causing further harm. Worrying about covering tracks wastes precious time and attention in a dangerous situation that could be spent on awareness of surroundings, gathering belongings, and safely escaping the situation.</p><br><p>*Common characteristics of abusive relationships include controlling behavior and violation of privacy. This can lead to digital surveillance, when an abuser goes through a survivor's notifications, call history, messages, social media, browsing history, and other apps on their devices, looking for potential threats, or something to pick a fight over. Digital surveillance poses a challenge for individuals experiencing domestic violence to safely engage with resources that could help get them out of danger.</p></div></div><div id="goals" class="sky"><div class="section-header cardless-item"><hr><h2>Goals</h2></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Goals</h5><ul><li>Support survivors in seeking help before, during and after escape.</li><li>Help individuals experiencing domestic violence plan their escape with expert recommendations</li><li>Reduce cognitive load during emergency escapes from domestic violence</li><li>Safely connect survivors with their contacts in domestic violence emergency</li><li>Safely connect survivors with local resources such as case managers, shelters and therapists</li><li>Encourage secure documentation of abuse for personal reference and use in legal proceedings</li></ul></div><div id="solution" class="lemon"><div class="section-header cardless-item"><hr><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Store Information Privately</h5><p>Abusers looking for suspicious apps, contacts, and messages on the survivor’s phone will find a false front for the app. Privacy is further ensured through passcode protection, providing a safe place for survivors to prepare for an escape.</p><div class="info-card problem-statement"><div class="flex flex-row"><span class="gradient-line s-l"></span><p class="p-statement lg:ml-4 lg:w-2/3">“<em>I give it a 10</em> on it being secretly disclosed as a [redacted] and nobody knowing what the app might be on your phone <em>even if they got your phone from you</em> or and looked through your phone.” - Anonymous Survivor</p></div></div></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Emergency Contacts in Send Codes</h5><p>Individuals who experience domestic violence have a safety practice of using inconspicuous secret codes to communicate to trusted allies that they are in trouble.
