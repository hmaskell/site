                    <p>Vind is an iPad app that helps wine collectors keep track of their wines. Collectors represent
                        their collection in the app to keep track of the price, expiration, and count of each bottle.

                            <p>Zameel maintains a mid-sized collection with his wife, Sandy. His true interest in wine
                                began
                                in University when he took a Wine Science course, and learned to experience and analyze
                                each sip. He is often gifted wines by friends and family, and visits vineyards with his
                                wife
                                on holidays, usually departing
                                with a case in tow.</p>
                            </br>
                            <p>Zameel would love to select a bottle quickly while he lets dinner simmer, without having
                                to risk handling and disrupting each bottle until he finds a suitable pairing. He
                                struggles with keeping track of expiration dates and has found himself terribly
                                dissapointed when he left a bottle to age too long and it turned to vinegar. When
                                selecting a wine, he might have a specific grape or price range in mind, depending on
                                the occasion. When contemplating purchasing wine, he would like to know whether he has
                                previously enjoyed that wine, how many similar wines he already has, and whether the
                                price point is comparable to previous purchases of similar vintages.</p>

                    <li>Users felt they should not be allowed to edit History items, and that doing so would defeat
                        the purpose of the feature</li>
                    <li>When scanning a barcode to add a wine, if that wine already exists in the collection, users
                        felt the app should redirect to that wine’s profile page to edit the quantity instead of to
                        the “new wine” form</li>
                    <li>Conducted interviews with wine collectors & enthusiasts</li>
                    <li>Some information on wine profile pages was hidden below the fold, and users didn’t know
                        there was more to scroll to see</li>
                    <li>All users reported relative ease of use and expressed interest in the app for
                        personal use</li>
