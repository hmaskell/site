Designed to work in tandem with parametric generative design tools</p><h4>Problem Context</h4><p>Generative design software allows designers to easily generate thousands of design alternatives. However, selecting the best solution from thousands is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.</p><p>For her thesis, PhD candidate Naghmi Shireen observed patterns in designers' processes when tasked with physically sorting through 1000 solutions to select the best. Based on Shireen's findings, I designed an interface intended to support designers in the process of identifying the best design(s) out of thousands.</p><p>For this project, I was given the unique opportunity to work in the Computational Design Lab at Simon Fraser University under my professor Halil Erhan.</p><p>I co-authored a paper entitled ParaXplore: Uncovering Design Patterns when the Design Space is Loaded with Thousands of Solutions, detailing research investigating the potential for a creativity support tool for designers who are working with more than 1000 design alternatives, with supporting mockups demonstrating how this research could inform an interface to facilitate this process. The paper was submitted to CHI 2019, an ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, along with the following demo video I created to showcase Shireen's research and my prototype.</p><h4>Sampling</h4><p>Shireen found that when participants were given 1000 design alternatives to sort through, they would often use a strategy she calls "Sampling". This refers to analyzing a subset of 20-25 alternatives, a chunk off the original 1000, reducing the cognitive overload of considering all 1000 at once. The number of designs included in a sample varied from participant to participant and throughout the process.</p><p>In ParaXplore, Sampling is how users view designs. After uploading the set of images they wish to sort though, users immediately take a sample to start the process through the SAMPLE button. From here, users can see a manageable sample of designs and will begin to understand the essential criteria that any winning design must meet.</p><h4>Assessing Designs and Assigning to Collections</h4><p>When designs meet user-specified criteria, they can be added to a Collection named after the criteria the designs within it meet. When designs do not meet the criteria, they can be added into a Rejected collection, mirroring the process of participants in Shireen's study.</p><h4>Managing Collections</h4><p>In the later stages of the evaluation process, as participants' ideal design became more defined to themselves, they would often mass-rearrange the contents of their collections. In other words, they would merge similar collections into one, branch off a collection into two collections based on more specific criteria, or reject whole collections upon realizing that the criteria the designs inside met was weaker than others.</p><h4>Generated Recommendations</h4><p>Based on the strength and weakness of each design indicated through the number of Collections a design is a part of, the number of positive and negative tags, and the value of the fondness slider, a Best Options collection is automatically generated.</p><h4>Timeframe and Tools</h4><p>Over the course of 4 months, Shireen and I met weekly for consultations to discuss ideas for the proposed functionality and interface in relation to her research, we went through cycles of sketching, discussing, prototyping, demonstrating and evaluating. I used Adobe XD to create mockups from sketches and to create an interactive prototype.</p><div class="info-card"><h5>Future Plans</h5><ul><li>Conduct an Expert Review to measure the success of proposed interface</li><li>Further iteration & testing</li><li>Build ParaXplore with the help of other Research Assistants in the Computational Design Lab at Simon Fraser University</li><li>Submit research paper to conferences & academic journals *presented at SigCHI 2019</li></ul></div><h4>Future Plans</h4><p>Shireen plans to conduct an Expert Review to measure the success of my proposed interface. After further iteration and testing, she plans to build ParaXplore with the help of other Research Assistants in the Computational Design Lab at Simon Fraser University. Our research paper has been submitted to several conferences and academic journals.</p><p>Given the chance to explore another iteration of this project, I would focus on Criteria Applying. When it is decided that a design meets one criteria, the flow is clear. However, if a design meets multiple criteria, the current flow would be to duplicate the design and add each copy to a collection representing the criteria the design meets. However, a user could also simply apply several positive tags to a design for each criteria met. I would like to explore the interaction of adding a design to multiple collections at once. For example, the user indicates they would like to add the design to a collection, the system asks "which collection(s)?", and the user can select as many as they see fit.</p><div id="define" class="sky"><div class="section-header cardless-item"><hr><h2>Define</h2></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Analysis Strategies</h5><ul><li>Affinity Diagramming to reveal trends and themes</li><li>Created a persona from findings to help weigh design desisions against intended audience</li></ul></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Findings</h5><div class="chunked-list"><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Common Activities</p><ul><li>Drinking wine</li><li>Finding pairings for wine</li><li>Storing + managing their collection</li><li>Attending wine festivals + tastings</li><li>Visiting wineries</li><li>“Having a nice cellar as a sort of status symbol.”</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Common Goals</p><ul><li>Drinking good wine</li><li>Appreciating and collecting wine</li><li>Sharing wine with loved ones</li><li>Hunting down rare wines</li><li>Visiting wineries as a social experience</li><li>“Bringing something special to the table when I'm with fellow enthusiasts.”</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Common Frustrations</p><ul><li>Not remembering which bottles they have</li><li>Not remembering which bottles they liked</li><li>Not remembering where a wine was made</li><li>Not remembering when a wine expires</li><li>Not being able to trust reviews because of differences in preference</li><li>When a special wine is opened accidentally in co-owned collections</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Observations</p><ul><li>Individuals with large collections (100+ bottles) unanimously reported frustration with government wine regulations.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="info-card problem-statement"><h5>Problem Statement</h5><div class="flex flex-row"><span class="gradient-line s-l"></span><p class="p-statement">Wine collectors need a way to <em>capture the details of wines</em> so they don't need to <em>rely on memory</em> when selecting a wine, making purchasing decisions, and discussing wines.</p></div></div><div class="info-card"><div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row md:flex-1"><div class="persona-card w-full sm:flex-1"><h5>Persona</h5><div class="persona-img"><img src="vind/vind-zameel.png"></div><div class="persona-title"><h4>Zameel</h4></div><div class="persona-attributes"><div class="key-value-persona"><p class="caption">Age</p><p>38</p></div><div class="key-value-persona"><p class="caption">Status</p><p>Married</p></div><div class="key-value-persona"><p class="caption">Occupation</p><p>Real Estate</p></div><div class="key-value-persona"><p class="caption">Tech Literacy</p><p>Confident</p></div><div class="key-value-persona"><p class="caption">Wine Expertise</p><p>Novice</p></div><hr><div class=""><h5 class="leading-tight">"Wine is a living and breathing thing.</h5><p>It is a marriage of agricultural product with the love and expertise of a winemaker.
