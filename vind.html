His true interest in wine began in University when he learned to experience and analyze each sip in a Wine Science course. He is often gifted wines by friends and family, and visits vineyards with Sandy on holiday, routinely heading home with a case of wine to add to their collection.</p><br><p class="caption">Goals</p><p>Zameel wants to select a wine without leaving the kitchen as dinner simmers, and without handling and disrupting other bottles before making a selection.</p><p>When selecting a wine for drinking, he might have a specific grape or price range in mind, depending on the occasion. When contemplating purchasing wine, he would like to know whether he has previously enjoyed that wine, how many similar wines he already has, and whether the price point is comparable to previous purchases of similar vintages.</p><br><p class="caption">Frustrations</p><p>He struggles to remember when the expensive wines in his collection will expire. He fears he will forget a special bottle and leave it to turn to vinegar in his cellar. When discussing wines with fellow wine enthusiasts or when looking to restock favourite bottles, he struggles to remember the details of a bottle including the varietal, vintage, price, country, house, and his tasting notes for that bottle.</p><br></div></div></div></div></div><div id="ideate" class="lemon"><div class="section-header cardless-item"><hr><h2>Ideate</h2></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Themes</h5><div class="chunked-list"><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Collection Organizer</p><ul class=""><li>Represent adding and removing wines</li><li>Provide storage guidelines</li><li>Improve wine searchability</li><li>Provide historical record of collection</li><li>Encourage documentation of tasting notes for wines</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Social Rating and Recommendations</p><ul><li>Share tasting notes with Vind community</li><li>Search and browse community reivews to see how they reviewed wines</li><li>Scan wine label to search</li><li>Community-sourced pairing recommendations</li><li>Wine education through resource sharing</li><li>“Watch” a wine to be notified when ratings are released for a vintage of interest</li><li>Earn points to increase user review credibility by sharing tasting notes that others find helpful</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Wine Reminders</p><ul><li>Specific wine releases from vineyards</li><li>Rating releases from notable wine contests and festivals</li><li>When to open vintages (reaching and leaving ideal aging for most rich tasting experience)</li><li>When to re-stock wines</li><li>Quarter-turn notification (to prevent oxidization)</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Sketches</h5><div class="sketch-chunk"><h5 class="index">01</h5><div class="sketch-and-cap"><img src="vind/collectionsketch_3.png"><div class="sketch-info"><p class="caption">Collection Homescreen - 01</p><p>Select a wine based on vintage, varietal, and price point.

Further iterations also introduced the option to 'See All' wines in a category, which could then be filtered and sorted. Further iterations included categories for Price Range and Year as these may be key factors in selecitng a wine.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="prototype" class="peach"><div class="cardless-item"><hr><h2>Prototype</h2></div><div class="cardless-item"><iframe class="figma-prototype" style="border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="!00%" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FPqtyCG1qXpzQngcU75pmsG%2FVind" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><div id="test" class="sky"><div class="cardless-item"><hr><h2>Test</h2></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Research Method</h5><ul><li>Think-Aloud user studies with interactive prototype</li></ul></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Key Findings</h5><ul><li>Users felt they should not be allowed to edit History items, and that doing so would defeat the purpose of the feature</li><li>When scanning a barcode to add a wine, if that wine already exists in the collection, users felt the app should redirect to that wine’s profile page to edit the quantity instead of to the “new wine” form</li><li>Conducted interviews with wine collectors & enthusiasts</li><li>Some information on wine profile pages was hidden below the fold, and users didn’t know there was more to scroll to see</li><li>All users reported relative ease of use and expressed interest in the app for personal use</li></ul></div></div><div id="reflect" class="lemon"><div class="cardless-item"><hr><h2>Reflect</h2></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Key Takeaways</h5><ul><li>Interactive prototypes are fantastic for testing usability</li><li>Testing must be conducted with intended audience to truly test validity of solution for audience problem</li><li>Project would have benefitted from testing in context and another round of iteration</li></ul></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Further Research Questions</h5><div class="chunked-list"><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Collection Organizer</p><ul><li>How might we improve the process of reflecting bulk wine purchases in the app?</li><li>How might we improve the process of finding a wine in a collector’s physical collection after selecting a bottle through the app?</li><li>How might we accurately and efficiently represent pairing information for a dish?</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Social Rating and Recommendations</p><ul><li>Exactly what information are sommeliers interested in ascertaining about others’ experiences with a given wine?</li><li>How might we prompt users to give standardized, brief, fully informative tasting notes?</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Wine Reminders</p><ul><li>Which reminders would be most valued or irrelevant in practice?</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">History</p><ul><li>Could notifications and history be combined to create a centralized info-hub?</li><li>Is a history log as useful a feature to collectors as we had imagined it to be?</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cardless-item"></div><div id="footer"><div id="call-to-action" class=""><hr class="ml-4 md:hidden"><div class="flex flex-col max-w-7xl mx-auto pb-4 px-4 sm:px-6 sm:flex-row md:pt-4 lg:pb-0"><div class="contact-cta"><h2 class="">Ready to meet?</h2><p class="subhead">Let's connect!</p></div><div class="flex flex-row justify-end contact-button pt-4 sm:pt-0"><div class="icon-button"><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/heathermaskell" target="blank"><i class="ph-linkedin-logo"></i></a></div><div class="icon-button"><a href="https://instagram.com/heathermaskell.design" target="blank"><i class="ph-instagram-logo"></i></a></div><div class="icon-button"><a href="mailto:hello@heathermaskell.com" target="blank"><i class="ph-envelope"></i></a></div></div></div></div><div class="text-center p-4 lemon tracking-wide"><p class="caption">Made by hand with love &hearts; 2021</p></div></div><script src="bundle.js"></script></body></html>
